## Algorithms

**A-star (A\*)** can be used to solve the n-puzzle. You can find **[here](https://algorithmsinsight.wordpress.com/graph-theory-2/a-star-in-general/implementing-a-star-to-solve-n-puzzle/)** a realy good explaination of it.  
If I have to summurize it:  
- First, I would say that each node represent a state of the puzzle. Therefore, each node has a maxium of 4 new childrens (the blank part going up, down, right or left). It will then expend until the n-puzzle is solve.
- Second, each node is going to be given a score depending on the **heuristic** which is named **f**. The node with the lower **f score** is chosen to continue the loop.  

This algorithm is storing in an **open** list the nodes that are not visited and in a **closed** list the nodes that are visisted, if there are no more **open** nodes the n-puzzle is not solvable.  

**Iterative Deepening (IDA\*)** is going to be the same as the **A-start** algorithm but it will use less memory. Indeed, it does not use the **open** and **closed** list, instead it use a threshold that is going to be set arbritrary at first. Once the threshold is reach, the smalest **f score** node is going to be the new threshold. Then, the algorithm restart from the begining.  

Therefore, we have here a choice to make, either take a more time efficient algorithm, or take a more space efficient algroithm.
It will need to be chose by the team, but we need to keep in mind that the correction is going to be more focus on the 3x3.

## Solvability
In order to optimize the algorithm, it is possible to check if a puzzle is solvable or not. This will help us detect node that we don't want to check further, but also check if a puzzle is solvable or not.  

#### The checks
In general, for a given grid of width N, we can find out check if a N*N â€“ 1 puzzle is solvable or not by following below simple rules :  
- If N is odd, then puzzle instance is solvable if number of inversions is even in the input state.
- If N is even, puzzle instance is solvable if :  
  - the blank is on an even row counting from the bottom (second-last, fourth-last, etc.) and number of inversions is odd.
  - the blank is on an odd row counting from the bottom (last, third-last, fifth-last, etc.) and number of inversions is even.  

For all other cases, the puzzle instance is not solvable

#### The inversion  
If we assume the tiles written out in a single row (1D Array) instead of being spread in N-rows (2D Array), a pair of tiles (a, b) form an inversion if a appears before b but a > b. 
If we concider a taquin like this :  
**1 2 4**  
**3 5 6**  
**7 8 x**  
And we put it in a 1D array: **1 2 4 3 5 6 7 8**, we can see that:  
- **4-3** is an inversion.  

Another more complex example:  
**1 8 3**  
**2 6 5**  
**7 4 X**  
We put it in a 1D array: **1 8 3 2 6 5 7 4**, we can see that :
- **8-3, 8-2, 8-6, 8-5, 8-7, 8-4** (6 inversions)  
- **3-2** (1 inversion)  
- **6-5, 6-4** (2 inversions)  
- **5-4** (1 inversion)  
- **7-4** (1 inversion)  

Which mean we have **6 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 11 inversions**. Here the n-puzzle is **not solvable**.

Now you must understand that the algroithm can be optimize with this.


## The f score
The **f score** is calculated doing f(x) = g(x) + h(x); where x is the current node, g(x) is the depth of the node and h(x) is the heuristic chose.  
For this project we have to implement 3 Heuristics and the Manhatan distance must be one of them.  
Therefore, we will have : 
- The Manhatan distance
- The Euclidian distance
- Tiles out of place

## Admissible heuristics
An admissible heuristic must never overestimates the cost, which means that the number of move required by the heuristic to finish the puzzle must be less or equal than the minimum number of move to reach the goal.
Examples :
- Manhatan distance calculate the sum of how many move in rows and columns needs a tile to be at the right place.
- Euclidian distance calculate the sum of the hypothenus between each point
- Tiles out of place calculate the sum of the missplaced tile
For each one of these heuristic the tiles cannot move that way so it will take more than the heuristic to actually finish the puzzle, therefore it is an admissible heuristic.
