# Project research

## The goal
The goal of this projet is to create an algorithm that can solve the game [n-puzzle (taquin in french)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle). It must be able to solve 3x3, 4x4 etc. However, the correction is going to be specific to solving the 3x3 as fast as possible.  
For a puzzle NxN the bigger the N is the higher the resolution time is goig to be.
